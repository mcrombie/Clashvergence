Objective:
Create a geographically accurate map of the Greater Virginia region for a Risk-like strategy game.

Map Design:
Regions Included: Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.

Territory Boundaries:
Use county-level data to define territories or group counties into regions for simplification.

Geographic Accuracy:
Use shapefiles or GeoJSON data for state/county boundaries.
Assign real-world latitude/longitude coordinates for nodes (territories).

Data Sources:
Shapefiles: Download state/county boundaries from Census TIGER/Line.

Territory Data:
Define connections (neighbors) and metadata (e.g., ownership, armies) for each territory.

Visualization:
Background Map:
Use geopandas and matplotlib to plot state/county boundaries.

Territories:
Overlay territories as polygons or points with labels.
Show connections (e.g., lines between adjacent territories).

Game Data:
Use colors for ownership, sizes for armies, and labels for names.
Next Steps:
Step 1: Download state/county shapefiles.
Step 2: Process shapefiles to filter Greater Virginia regions.
Step 3: Define territories by grouping counties.
Step 4: Visualize the map with territories and game data.
Step 5: Integrate game mechanics (e.g., combat, reinforcements) with the map
