This project is meant as a fun and educational way for me to get back into coding after years spent focused on writing a book.
I find Large Language Models fascinating and have been playing with them obsessively for months.
I am using Open AI as a "cointeligence" to help me write this project.
By doing so, I suspect I can avoid innumerable mistakes and save an enormous amount of time.
Already, I find just explaning my project idea and asking it for a roadmap of how I should develop it has been immensely useful.
What has plagued most of my projects in the past has consistently been my failure to spend enough time in the planning stage so that I can avoid costly mistakes. 
My plan right now is to gradually follow the roadmap OpenAI has generated for me, working on it some each day.
I am not finished with my book yet, so between that and my work at the wine store I am not yet ready to devote a major portion of my time to development.
I am still working through an online tutorial to review the basics of AI development. 
For now, I am going to progress through the course some each day and slowly begin building out my practice project here. 
This README will just be like a development journal until I am done.

Here is what I told OpenAI my idea is: "My idea at this early stage is to make a risk-like (the board game) simulation where empires battle for control over a map. The rules should be fairly simple, like the board game, so I can focus on the nuances of the AIs being used to make each empire's decisions. For example, one could be extremely defensive, another offensive, and another adaptive. My idea is to make it mor of a simulator than a game"
